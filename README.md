# that-react-redux-express-app-you-want

Based on my original project: [that-react-app-you-want].

Now you get yourself:
- [react]
- [redux]
- [express] server.
- [hot module reloading]

The [hot module reloading] does include the [express] server, too.

That should help you out, buckaroo.

Woohoo.
